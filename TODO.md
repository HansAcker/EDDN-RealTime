## Frontend TODO: possibly...
- pause/buffer tables
  - make the tables a few rows longer than displayed
  - on scroll down, pause updates / buffer new rows until a scroll/jump to top
  - scrolling tables interferes with scrolling the page
  - hold shift to pause table under cursor? not great on touchpads, either
- extend Dashboard component
  - save/load/share layout, config, dynamic imports
- interactive config overlay
  - drag / resize components
  - general config for locales / formats / other options
- add a "loading" indicator / messages
  - unless that slows down loading...
- non-table modules: (2D) map, graphs
  - Region Pie-Chart Web Component
- revert the dynamic template fetch, integrate them back into index.html?
  - message details are mostly in English, anyway
- use complete row/cell templates, assign slots for data
  - so that templates can define cell order
- rework DataTable modules to re-use a pool of DOM nodes
  - re-using <tr> rows is easy enough, re-fitting their <td> cells more complex
- listen to visibilitychange events and start/stop/sync page updates
  - requestAnimationFrame is actually good enough for the tables
- test/complete the optional AbortController signal logic
  - not required nor used in current always-on page
  - mainly needed to detach ReconnectingWebSocket's event handlers from `window`
- optional EDDNClient SharedWorker where available
  - shared websocket/parsing between multiple tabs
  - filter per tab
- rework StatsBox


## Websocket server TODO: possibly...
- type-safe constructor args instead of **kwargs
- handle/discard incoming client messages
  - the current client should not send anything and would just get itself disconnected for missing pongs
- re-think monitor_task lifecycle
  - is monitoring the write buffer actually needed? missing pongs would disconnect a stalled client soon
- possibly use Event or similar to implement the lazy disconnect?
- InterpreterPoolExecutor could be better suited to offload JSON, requires python >=3.14
- run a profiler to find the actual hot spots
  - orjson vs json does not make much of a difference for small message sizes
  - orjson saves a bytes -> str -> bytes conversion
  - offload_threshold/run_in_executor is probably not needed
- continue to ignore signal handler incompatibility with native Windows, the server works under WSL
- keep compatibility with python 3.8 for now
- review LLM-generated docstrings
